# Trajectory-control-for-an-Industrial-Robot-Arm

This repository contains the Python code files used for the research described in the paper titled: "Trajectory control based on On/Off, Fuzzy Logic and Convolutional Neural Networks for an Industrial Robot Arm: an experimental comparison", so that the obtained results can be reproduced.

Below is the description of the files uploaded to the repository:

- `seguidor_de_linea_ON-OFF.py`: Control code for the industrial arm trajectory using the ON-OFF algorithm.

- `seguidor_de_linea_fuzzy.py`: Control code for the industrial arm trajectory using fuzzy logic algorithm.

- `fuzzy_dataset_gen.py`: Data generation code for training the neural network using the fuzzy logic control algorithm. The generated data consists of image type and numerical values of the pixel difference between the left and right sides of the image, as well as the values in X and Y followed by the robot.

- `entrenamiento_CNN.ipynb`: Python notebook describing the process of training the neural network using the data generated by `fuzzy_dataset_gen.py`. Here, the neural network model named `cnn_modelo.kera` is trained and exported.

- `seguidor_de_linea_CNN.py`: Control code for the industrial arm trajectory using neural networks.

- `comparacion_resultados.ipynb`: Python notebook comparing the trajectory graphs obtained by the three control algorithms. Libraries are used to obtain corresponding comparison metrics with the original curve.

Important Notes:

- Within the following OneDrive link is the folder that stores both the data used to train the neural network (images in the "im" folder and pixel difference data as well as X and Y positions in the "data.xlsx" file). All of this is stored in the compressed folder named "Datos CNN.zip", and this data is used by the file "entrenamiento_CNN.ipynb" to train the convolutional neural network.
- Within the same folder is the exported model in keras format named "cnn_modelo.keras" generated in the file "entrenamiento_CNN.ipynb". This model is used by the file "seguidor_de_linea_CNN.py" to control the trajectory of the industrial robot using the trained neural network.
